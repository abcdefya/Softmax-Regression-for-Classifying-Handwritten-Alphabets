# Softmax Regression for Classifying Handwritten Alphabets

This repository houses a project that employs Softmax Regression to classify handwritten alphabets. As a generalization of logistic regression for multiclass classification problems, Softmax Regression is an optimal choice for differentiating between the numerous classes of alphabet letters.

 I extend my gratitude to Dr. Pham Thi Hoai, whose deep expertise in machine learning and deep learning, combined with her enthusiastic support for students, has been instrumental in guiding me to the successful completion of this project.
